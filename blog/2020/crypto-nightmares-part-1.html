	  				Tales from the Crypt(o)... How WES avoids giving you nightmares
	  			</h1>

	  			<p class="text-justify">
	  				<i>
	  					In the first of a semi-regular series, Eddie Chng, our Head of Business Development, takes us through a slew of challenges in the cryptocurrency world and how Wowoo Exchange Singapore (WES) is battling them.
	  				</i>
	  			</p>

	  			<p class="text-justify">
	  				One thing Ashish (our venerable CEO), has tried to ensure from day one, is that we learn from the mistakes that other exchanges have made in the past (and often still continue to make today). Recent incidents involving a number of exchanges have served as a timely reminder that choosing which exchange you use is crucial.
	  			</p>

	  			<p class="text-justify">
	  				Hacks. Exchanges that grind to a halt right when you need to buy or sell. Money that never arrives. Ridiculous fees.  that Have you ever lived through a crypto nightmare?
	  			</p>

	  			<p class="text-justify">
	  				Having a team that has varying levels of experience in trading crypto (and used a wide range of exchanges in the past), has allowed us to have an early-warning system (of sorts) to several problems which seem to be inherent to crypto exchanges. The WES team has continually strived to circumvent as many of these problems as possible, putting us on the right path to create an exchange that is truly for everyone.
	  			</p>

	  			<p class="text-justify">
	  				As the cryptocurrency field matures, many of the issues in this series of posts can hopefully be relegated to history as growing pains of an ever evolving industry. But even if these nightmares become (hopefully!) rarer, I think it’s useful to record all of these nightmares, both as cautionary tales, and as a history of the evolution of this industry.
	  			</p>

	  			<h2 class="mt-4">KYC, easy as 1-2-3?</h2>
	  			<p class="text-center">
	  				<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/dWy2WwcB3wvX8QA1Iu" align="middle" width="480" height="298" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" style="pointer-events: none;" allowFullScreen ></iframe>
	  			</p>

	  			<p class="text-justify">“Your identity is being verified. This will take 3-5 minutes”.</p>

	  			<p class="text-justify">
	  				Sound’s pretty painless. So you leave the window open, make a little snack, call your mum, whatever.
	  			</p>

					<p class="text-justify">
						Three hours later, and you’re still stuck on the same screen...
					</p>

					<p class="text-justify">
						No amount of gamification is going to make providing your ID documents and proof of address any form of fun. However, there’s no reason to make it even more painful by forcing a user to sit there, leave the window open, and wait for the verification process to complete. Meanwhile, the price has gone up, along with your blood pressure.
					</p>

					<p class="text-justify">
						Wowoo Exchange Singapore thankfully, does not ask you to sit by your screen while we verify your identity. We typically get your KYC reviewed within one business day. Very soon, we'll be integrated with MyInfo, which will make it an absolute breeze for Singaporeans to submit details to us!
					</p>

					<h2>Withdrawal symptoms</h2>
					<p class="text-center">
	  				<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/RMkhKPXCPDHHhTB1Qs" align="middle" width="480" height="285" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" style="pointer-events: none;" allowFullScreen ></iframe>
	  			</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
						How long would you wait for a withdrawal? Days? Weeks? Months? Sometimes it’s an operational bottleneck. Or maybe, it’s because an exchange has lost a bank account, and has no way to even process your withdrawal.
					</p>

					<p class="text-justify">
						And it’s not just withdrawals - nothing is more frustrating than watching Bitcoin’s price go up, and your deposit to the exchange is nowhere to be seen.
					</p>

					<p class="text-justify">
						So what makes WES different? We partner with Xfers, a payment processor that was awarded a WA SVF license in Singapore in 2019, which stands for...,<checks notes>... Widely Accepted Stored Value Facility. It positively trips off the tongue. Only six of these licenses have been awarded by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). You probably won’t have heard of this license, but you will have heard of other approved WA SVF companies. EZ-Link, NETS, NETS Flashpay, and Capitavoucher by Capitaland are some of the companies awarded this license (at the time of writing). We feel that partnering with Xfers is a great step to ensuring our customers in Singapore have a quick and easy way to deposit and withdraw from their Wowoo Exchange Singapore account. Xfers will be migrating to the new licenses under the Payment Services Act eventually, and we look forward to continue working with them in the future!
					</p>

					<p class="text-justify">
						We are, of course, reviewing other partners to provide more deposit/withdrawal options, as our customer base becomes more international, and hope to have some announcements regarding this over the course of the year!
					</p>

					<h2>Volatility killed the cat</h2>
					<p class="text-center">
	  				<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/9OEura8wCO04U" align="middle" width="480" height="322" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" style="pointer-events: none;" allowFullScreen ></iframe>
	  			</p>

					<p class="text-justify">
						Cryptocurrency markets are often volatile. This has slowly improved as the industry has evolved, but, hey, traders like volatility, right? Buy low, and sell high? Yes.
					</p>

					<p class="text-justify">But also...no.</p>

					<p class="text-justify">
						When exchanges suffer flash crashes, or flash pumps, it can be due to a variety of reasons.
					</p>

					<p class="text-justify">
						1. Someone has entered a trade in error, and entered a buy (or sell) way too big for the market - a fat finger trade. Maybe, they accidentally sold 100 Bitcoin all at once. One of those, #shouldhavestayedinbed moments.
					</p>

					<p class="text-justify">
						2. The liquidity has dried up, so even a small trade will push the price wildly up or down.
					</p>

					<p class="text-justify">
						3. The exchange is matching trades in error. As recently as 2019, an exchange (that will remain unnamed), was testing a new trade type in their live environment, and accidentally allowed users to buy at US$8,000, and sell at US$12,000, when the market price was around US$10,000.
					</p>

					<p class="text-justify">
						Flash crashes are problematic for a crypto exchange. It’s even more of an issue if you’re taking leveraged positions using margin trading, which is something a lot of exchanges offer - often implemented badly.
					</p>

					<p class="text-justify">
						A flash crash (even if it only lasts for a split-second) could trigger a closing of your position, and the next time you log in, you’ll see a LOT less money in your balance, and be left wondering why did your leveraged trade close out at a loss, when the price is the same as it was yesterday.
					</p>

					<p class="text-justify">
						So, how does WES mitigate against this happening?

						<ol>
							<li>We've worked hard on our UI to reduce the chance you make errors when using our platform.</li>
							<li>
								We work with reputable market makers to ensure that there’s strong liquidity in our trading pairs. We don’t list hundreds of trading pairs, with empty order books.
							</li>
							<li>
								We have a robust process in place to ensure that new features are rigorously tested before they are released into production.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
						As for margin trading? It’s not something we currently offer, but rest assured, a lot of careful consideration will go into it if we ever do.
					</p>
