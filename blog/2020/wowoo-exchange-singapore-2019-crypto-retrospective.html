	        <h2>CRYPTOCURRENCY IN 2019 AT A GLANCE</h2>
					<p class="text-justify">
						On a macro level, the year was marked by global debt levels rising and political instability, with protestors taking to the streets fighting political and economic inequality. Further, technology companies started to make further inroads into financial services.
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
						All three of these factors can be seen as wider reasons for a general crypto asset market recovery in 2019, a stark contrast to crypto prices in 2018. Bitcoin continued its journey from value store to a safe haven asset. Ethereum held its position as the leading smart contract platform, with <i>Decentralized Finance</i> emerging as the strongest use case.
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
						Gaming and developer tools (such as node infrastructure and data analytics) continued to be a focus for many and grew substantially. Finally, prime brokerage stacks continued to be developed, with the likes of exchange, custody and execution services being tackled
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
						If there was one defying continued movement in crypto assets during the year, it was the continued acceptance (and acquisition) of cryptocurrency from three key segments:
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
						1. Retail users: in general, digital assets continue to resonate with millennials.
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
						2. Institutions: financial incumbents and technology companies introduced products to meet both retail and institutional demand. Samsung and HTC both have introduced phones with built in Cryptocurrency wallets, and we can't go without mentioning Facebook’s Libra project, that was probably the most eye-catching. However, the launch of ICE's Bakkt, alongside CME's existing offerings, means we now have fully regulated bitcoin futures products, from two of the most established exchanges, and covering both physical and cash settlement. Add to this Fidelity growing its custody offering for crypto assets, we now have a regular stream of announcements from established, reputable financial firms establishing a presence within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, a sure sign of the industry maturing - headlines that would previously have caused a euphoric wave of excitement and the accompanying price action, now just act as an additional piece of the puzzle in place.
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
						3. Nation states: began exploring the concept of central bank digital currencies (CBDC). On a global level, many nations leaned into the regulatory environment proposing new regulations and laws. Countries are at different stages of "First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win".
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
						2019 was a big year for Wowoo Exchange Singapore as well.
					</p>

					<h2 class="mt-5">WOWOO EXCHANGE SINGAPORE IN 2019</h2>
					<h2>It lives!</h2>
					<p class="text-justify">
						Obviously, the major event for WES in 2019 was the platform going live in October. The culmination of tech teams in Singapore and Japan, our supremely dedicated Operations team in Singapore, the platform has already gone under various changes with interface improvements and functionality updates. It will continue to evolve, adapt and improve…but October 2019 will remain our most important milestone.
					</p>

					<h2>Meeting and greeting</h2>
					<p class="text-justify">
						From participation at <i>Singapore FinTech Festival</i>, to our very own <i>Crypto Thirstday</i>, Wowoo Exchange Singapore did not shy away from coming out to meet the public - and the public did not disappoint with challenging questions and feedback about the Exchange and our platform. This is something we have been grateful as it is our most direct avenue of communication with our users and cryptocurrency enthusiasts, and all this interaction has meant the constant evolution of our platform and services, such as the <i>Instant Trade</i> feature introduced in November. In 2020 WES will expand its presence at events to enable us to talk directly with those closest to our platform: the users.
					</p>

					<h2>Partnerships that we publicly announced</h2>
					<p class="text-justify">
						We've been blessed to work with fantastic partners in Singapore. Established, reputable firms that allow us to service you, our customers, and allow us collectively to grow the industry locally. <i>Xfers</i> is a good example of a MAS licensed partner that brings us and our clients comfort, in providing a regulated, reliable, and rapid service.
					</p>

					<h2>The evolution of the company</h2>
					<p class="text-justify">
						Platform, aside, one of the greatest pleasures of 2019 was the building of the WES team, across the region, from Singapore, to the Philippines, to Japan. We began 2019 with just two people and a dream. We finished 2019 with over twenty people, across three countries, a fully specced customer service centre, and a platform capable of trading Singapore dollars for Bitcoin and Ethereum. And this is just the beginning.
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
						With our management team now stronger than ever, we are well placed to continue to grow as 2020 approaches.
					</p>
					<p class="mt-5 font-italic">
