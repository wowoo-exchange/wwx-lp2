<p class="text-justify">
					<a href="wowoo-exchange-singapore-2019-crypto-retrospective.html">Following on from my 2019 retrospective</a>, I wanted to look ahead to the year ahead in the crypto sphere. I've been in this industry long enough to know how hard it is to predict, but here's what I am expecting over the course of the year. Some predictions are bolder than others!
					</p>
<br>
					<h2>1. CBDC will become a familiar term...</h2>
					<p class="text-justify">
						One of the underlying trends of 2019 was the increasing acceptance of crypto technology, to the point that central banks of several countries are even developing their own blockchain infrastructures and cryptocurrencies. China has entered the global competition, backed by substantial funding and the technical know-how that has driven its economy over the last decade. and is driving innovation with its deep pockets, with a now official embracing of blockchain technology from the top. The Bank of England is beginning discussions with other central banks to ensure that they don't get left behind. I expect Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) to carve out their own identity alongside existing cryptocurrencies over the course of the year.
					</p>
<br>
					<h2>2. ...which will make Libra an even tougher sell</h2>
					<p class="text-justify">
						Any country creating a CBDC will be even more hostile towards Facebook's Libra project, at least in its current guise. 2020 is sink or swim time for the initiative. So far this year they've already had one casualty, with Vodafone dropping out. I think there will likely be further changes to the project soon. Even then, that might not be enough to save it. Perhaps offering to add CBDCs into the basket backing Libra's coin might be enough to entice governments to work with Facebook.
					</p>
<br>
					<h2>3. Regulatory clarity for cryptocurrency exchanges</h2>
					<p class="text-justify">
In 2020 we should finally reach the stage where exchanges are no longer being forced to operate in grey areas. A growing number of countries with reputable financial markets are providing regulatory framework for exchanges to operate in. In our own backyard, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) should begin issuing their first round of licenses to companies handling digital payment tokens. This includes crypto exchanges such as Wowoo Exchange Singapore (stay tuned for updates on this as the year goes on!).
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
Now that FATF’s requirements have been digested by financial regulators globally, a standardized minimum requirement will bring a clear distinction between legitimate exchanges and those that should be steered away from. Compliance tools <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/elliptic-launches-elliptic-discovery-enabling-banks-to-identify-and-assess-their-exposure-to-crypto-assets-and-work-more-closely-with-crypto-exchanges-300972992.html">specializing in cryptocurrency flows like Elliptic</a> will continue to offer new solutions, some aimed at banks, giving these financial institutions the visibility they require to adequately assess risk so they can move on from a blanket zero tolerance on crypto related financial flows, to finally begin to open their doors to good actors within the industry.					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
The days of every man and his dog opening an exchange are numbered, and I for one am glad to see us progressing to the next stage. Until exchanges understand their part to play in preventing both money laundering and terrorist financing, we will not be offered, nor will we deserve, a seat at the table.
					</p>
<br>
<h2>4. No ETF, but crypto-derivatives will continue to grow </h2>
					<p class="text-justify">
I expect proper, regulated crypto derivatives to grow in both number of offerings and trading volumes.
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (CME) ongoing presence in the industry, from publishing a Bitcoin reference rate in November 2016, to going live with Bitcoin futures about a year later, has continued to add serious credibility to the industry. At the beginning of 2020, CME went live with options on Bitcoin futures. In the meantime, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), who own the New York Stock Exchange, have moved to offer both cash and physically settled futures, which should provide some interesting competition.
</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
The CME has maintained an Ethereum reference rate since May 2018, so there's a good chance they will announce an Ethereum future this year.
</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
Having said all this, a Bitcoin ETF is still looking over a year away. I'm expecting the usual cycle of applications being submitted, and then rejected or being withdrawn to continue. I'd love to be proved wrong on this one however!
</p>
<br>
<h2>5. Established banks launch cryptocurrency related initiatives</h2>
					<p class="text-justify">
It's not hard to spot the sprouting of crypto projects within banks. When a prominent bank like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/compliance-lead-scventures-crypto-venture-at-standard-chartered-bank-1442590203/">Standard Chartered posts jobs in London and Singapore for a crypto project</a>, you know something is happening. I have no doubt there are plenty more projects being worked on behind the scenes, and I'm expecting many of them to be publicly announced this year.
					</p>
<br>
<h2>6. Decentralized Finance will continue its strong 2019 into 2020</h2>
					<p class="text-justify">
<link>As I mentioned in my 2019 retrospective</link>, Decentralized Finance - popularly known as DeFi - has been gaining prominence due to a wide-range of advantages, such as allowing traders to easily switch between different debt positions. This trend will likely continue as financial services introduce fresh lending and margin trading facilities.
</p>
		  <br>
					<p class="text-justify">
<h2>7. The technology: better, faster, stronger</h2>
One of the exciting aspects of this industry is that there is constant innovation. Whether this is a second layer tech like lightning, amendments to established protocols, or increased interoperability allowing projects to complement each other, one thing is for certain - the industries' desire to continually improve means there's always something new around the corner. Collectively we may not always agree on what direction we should go exactly, but personally I'd be worried if everyone was just working on one project, all in agreement.
</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
Lightning's solution to facilitate faster, cheaper transactions off chain from Bitcoin's primary blockchain could enable bitcoin to be used for everyday transactions without making significant changes to its underlying setup, or perhaps another coin altogether might fill this gap. Only time will tell.
</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
2020 will also see a significant escalation of the arms race between privacy and decentralization  focused projects, and blockchain data analytics companies. Both sides will continue to advance their technologies, and exchanges will act as gatekeepers between the well funded institutional end of the market, and the crypto-underground, by deciding which projects can be traded, and enforcing KYC/AML standards on users.
</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
<br>
<h2>8. Institutional capital will start laying foundations in the cryptocurrency world</h2>
While it is unlikely to be a banner year for institutional investors in the crypto space, capital should slowly start to move into cryptocurrencies this year. The lack of speed is not simply tied to a perceived lack of trust in the industry; institutional investors have a multitude of legal obligations, restrictions, and requirements. A lack of cryptocurrency education within institutional investment circles is also a barrier, though it does seem institutions are beginning to consider their digital asset strategies. And while 2020 may not be the turning point for moving institutional capital into crypto, I predict it will be where the foundations are lain for the future.
