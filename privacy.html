          </ol>
          <p class="text-justify">
            While Users who are located in the EEA or the Channel Islands are customers of our Singapore entity, we recognize and, to the extent applicable to us, adhere to relevant EEA or the Channel Islands data protection laws.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            We may collect Personal Data from Users located in the EEA or the Channel Islands. To facilitate the services we provide to Users located in the EEA or the Channel Islands, we request explicit consent for the transfer of Personal Data from the EEA or the Channel Islands to a destination outside of the EEA and the Channel Islands. If you are an individual located in the EEA or the Channel Islands and you decline to consent to such transfer, you will no longer be able to use Wowoo Materials and our Wowoo Services. You will have the ability to withdraw Digital Assets and Legal Tender from your Account; however, all other functionality will be disabled.
          </p>
          <strong>Lawful Grounds to Process and Obtain Consent</strong>
          <p class="text-justify">
            We process the Personal Data of Users who are located in the EEA or the Channel Islands for one or more of several lawful purposes, including:
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            <span class="pr-3">(i)</span> To provide you with Wowoo Services, including customer service support;
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            <span class="pr-3">(ii)</span> To optimize and enhance Wowoo Services for all customers or for you specifically;
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            <span class="pr-3">(iii)</span> To comply with legal obligations, including to conduct anti-fraud and identity verification and authentication checks (you authorize us to share your Personal Data with our third-party service providers, who may also conduct their own searches of publicly available Personal Data about you); and
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            <span class="pr-3">(iv)</span> To monitor the usage of Wowoo Services, conduct automated and manual security checks of our service, to protect our rights and perform our lawful obligations.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Users in the EEA or the Channel Islands may withdraw consent at any time where consent is the lawful basis for processing their Personal Data. Should a User withdraw consent for processing or otherwise object to processing that impedes our ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations, a User may be unable to avail him or herself of the Services we provide.
          </p>
          <p>AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING</p>
          <p>We do not engage in automated decision-making.</p>
          <strong>Non-Disclosure of Personal Data</strong>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Our employees are prohibited, either during or after their employment, from disclosing Personal Data to any person or entity outside of our company, including family members, except under the circumstances described above. An employee is only permitted to disclose the Personal Data of a User to such other employees who need access to such information in order to deliver Wowoo Services to that User.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            If, as an EEA or Channel Islands Citizen, you believe that we have not adequately resolved any such issues, you have the right to contact your local supervisory authority.
