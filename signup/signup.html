You will be required to maintain in your Account a sufficient balance of the applicable Funds to satisfy any open Orders, your required margin and applicable fees.

Wowoo therefore does not serve as a central counterparty in such executed Trades entered between you and your Counterparty on the Platform, and does not have any contractual relationship with you and/or your Counterparty in relation to such executed Trades. Notwithstanding the above, Wowoo reserves the right to trade on the Platform as a User and upon execution of such Trade, as a Counterparty but you acknowledge and agree that in all other cases, whenever a transaction takes place between you and other User(s) on the Platform, Wowoo does not act as an intermediary but only provides a platform to complete the transaction(s) between the two parties, the buyer and the seller.

        </p>

        <b>6. PERSONAL DATA WE MAY SHARE WITH OTHER PARTIES</b>
        <p class="text-justify">We take care to allow Personal Data we collect from or in relation to you to be accessed only by those who really need to in order to perform their tasks and duties, and to share with third parties who have a legitimate purpose for accessing it. We will generally only share Personal Data we collect from or in relation to you in the following circumstances:
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">(i) We share your Personal Data with third party identity verification services and transaction monitoring services to prevent fraud and other illegal activities. This allows us to confirm your identity by comparing the information you provide us to public records and other third party databases. These service providers may create derivative data based on your Personal Data that can be used solely in connection with the provision of identity verification and fraud prevention services.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">(ii) We share your Personal Data with financial institutions and payment services providers with which we partner to process payments you have authorised.

        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">(v) We may share Personal Data we collect from or in relation to you with law enforcement agencies, regulatory authorised or other governmental authorities, officials, or other third parties when we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order, or similar legal procedure, or when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of Personal Data we collect from or in relation to you is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity or to investigate violations of our Terms and Conditions or any other applicable rules, policies or procedures.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">(vi) We may share Personal Data we collect from or in relation to you with companies or other entities that we plan to merge with or be acquired by.

You will receive prior notice of any change in applicable policies, including in the manner as set out in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <b>7. WHERE WE PROCESS AND STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</b>
        <p class="text-justify">Wowoo Exchange Singapore is headquartered in Singapore. Personal Data will be transmitted to data storage facilities where we keep our central records. Personal Data will also be transferred to our offices and appointed agents, where appropriate, in Singapore and around the world in connection with our performance of Wowoo Services. This means that Personal Data will be transferred to, and stored at a destination outside of your country. The Personal Data will also be processed by staff operating outside your country who work for us, for our suppliers or our business partners. Such staff are engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of Wowoo Services, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">It should also be noted that where we process and store your Personal Data using blockchain technology and relevant distributed or decentralised storage facilities, we will endeavour to protect your Personal Data in a similarly secured manner as that of a conventional storage facility.
        </p>

        <b>8. INFORMATION SECURITY</b>
        <p class="text-justify">We use our best endeavours to ensure confidentiality and protection of Personal Data we collect from or in relation to you, however, we cannot guarantee absolute security. We work hard to protect Personal Data we collect from or in relation to you from unauthorized access, alteration, modification, collection, use, disclosure, copying, disposal, destruction or similar risks. E.g. we use data encryption and firewalls and we restrict access to your Personal Data on a need to know basis for our employees, contractors and agents who require the information to fulfil their job responsibilities.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">Further, we cannot ensure the security or confidentiality of Personal Data that you transmit to us or receive from us via the internet or wireless connection.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">If you have reason to believe that your data is no longer secure, or if you become aware of any unauthorised access to or use of your account, please contact us at the email address compliance@wowoo.exchange.
        </p>

        <b>9. RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA</b>
        <p class="text-justify">We take steps to ensure that we retain Personal Data no longer than is necessary for the fulfillment of the purpose for which it was collected, unless the further retention of such Personal Data is otherwise permitted or required by applicable laws and regulations.
        </p>

        <b>10. UNDER-AGE PERSONAL DATA</b>
        <p class="text-justify">We do not knowingly request to collect Personal Data from any person under the age of 18. If a User submitting Personal Data is suspected of being younger than 18 years of age, we will require the User to close his or her account and will not allow the User to continue buying or selling digital currencies. We will also take steps to delete the Personal Data we collect from or in relation to such User as soon as possible. Please notify us if you know of any individuals under the age of 18 using Wowoo Services so we can take action to prevent access to Wowoo Services.
        </p>

        <b>11. EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA & CHANNEL ISLANDS PRIVACY STATEMENT</b>

        <p class="text-justify">(iv) To monitor the usage of Wowoo Services, conduct automated and manual security checks of our service, to protect our rights and perform our lawful obligations.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">Users in the EEA or the Channel Islands may withdraw consent at any time where consent is the lawful basis for processing their Personal Data. Should a User withdraw consent for processing or otherwise object to processing that impedes our ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations, a User may be unable to avail him or herself of the Services we provide.
        </p>

        <b>AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING</b>
        <p class="text-justify">We do not engage in automated decision-making.</p>

        <b>Non-Disclosure of Personal Data</b>
        <p class="text-justify">Our employees are prohibited, either during or after their employment, from disclosing Personal Data to any person or entity outside of our company, including family members, except under the circumstances described above.

        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          If, as an EEA or Channel Islands Citizen, you believe that we have not adequately resolved any such issues, you have the right to contact your local supervisory authority.
