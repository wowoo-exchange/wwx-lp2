          </p>

          <b>Enforcement of our Terms and Conditions</b>
          <p class="text-justify">Due to the nature of sensitive information we handle, it is important for us and for the benefit of our customers that we are actively monitoring, investigating, preventing and mitigating any potentially prohibited or illegal activities, enforcing our agreements with third parties, and/or violations of our Terms and Conditions or agreements related to the Services. We may use any of your Personal Data collected in connection with Wowoo Services for these purposes.

          </p>

        <p class="text-justify">We process your Personal Data for quality control and staff training to make sure we continue to provide you with accurate information.

        <b>5. THIRD PARTY INFORMATION WE RECEIVE</b>
        <p class="text-justify">As required and/or permitted by applicable law, we may obtain information about you from third party sources, such as public databases, credit bureaus and identification verification partners for purposes of verifying your identity.

        </p>

        <b>6. PERSONAL DATA WE MAY SHARE WITH OTHER PARTIES</b>

        <b>7. WHERE WE PROCESS AND STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</b>
        <p class="text-justify">Wowoo Exchange Singapore is headquartered in Singapore. Personal Data will be transmitted to data storage facilities where we keep our central records. Personal Data will also be transferred to our offices and appointed agents, where appropriate, in Singapore and around the world in connection with our performance of Wowoo Services. This means that Personal Data will be transferred to, and stored at a destination outside of your country. The Personal Data will also be processed by staff operating outside your country who work for us, for our suppliers or our business partners. Such staff are engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of Wowoo Services, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">It should also be noted that where we process and store your Personal Data using blockchain technology and relevant distributed or decentralised storage facilities, we will endeavour to protect your Personal Data in a similarly secured manner as that of a conventional storage facility.
        </p>

        <b>8. INFORMATION SECURITY</b>
        <p class="text-justify">We use our best endeavours to ensure confidentiality and protection of Personal Data we collect from or in relation to you, however, we cannot guarantee absolute security. We work hard to protect Personal Data we collect from or in relation to you from unauthorized access, alteration, modification, collection, use, disclosure, copying, disposal, destruction or similar risks. E.g. we use data encryption and firewalls and we restrict access to your Personal Data on a need to know basis for our employees, contractors and agents who require the information to fulfil their job responsibilities.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">Further, we cannot ensure the security or confidentiality of Personal Data that you transmit to us or receive from us via the internet or wireless connection.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">If you have reason to believe that your data is no longer secure, or if you become aware of any unauthorised access to or use of your account, please contact us at the email address compliance@wowoo.exchange.
        </p>

        <b>9. RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA</b>
        <p class="text-justify">We take steps to ensure that we retain Personal Data no longer than is necessary for the fulfillment of the purpose for which it was collected, unless the further retention of such Personal Data is otherwise permitted or required by applicable laws and regulations.
        </p>

        <b>10. UNDER-AGE PERSONAL DATA</b>
        <p class="text-justify">We do not knowingly request to collect Personal Data from any person under the age of 18. If a User submitting Personal Data is suspected of being younger than 18 years of age, we will require the User to close his or her account and will not allow the User to continue buying or selling digital currencies. We will also take steps to delete the Personal Data we collect from or in relation to such User as soon as possible. Please notify us if you know of any individuals under the age of 18 using Wowoo Services so we can take action to prevent access to Wowoo Services.
        </p>

        <b>11. EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA & CHANNEL ISLANDS PRIVACY STATEMENT</b>
        <p class="text-justify">While Users who are located in the EEA or the Channel Islands are customers of our Singapore entity, we recognize and, to the extent applicable to us, adhere to relevant EEA or the Channel Islands data protection laws.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">We may collect Personal Data from Users located in the EEA or the Channel Islands. To facilitate the services we provide to Users located in the EEA or the Channel Islands, we request explicit consent for the transfer of Personal Data from the EEA or the Channel Islands to a destination outside of the EEA and the Channel Islands. If you are an individual located in the EEA or the Channel Islands and you decline to consent to such transfer, you will no longer be able to use Wowoo Materials and our Wowoo Services. You will have the ability to withdraw Digital Assets and Legal Tender from your Account; however, all other functionality will be disabled.
        </p>

        <b>Lawful Grounds to Process and Obtain Consent</b>
        <p class="text-justify">We process the Personal Data of Users who are located in the EEA or the Channel Islands for one or more of several lawful purposes, including:</p>

        <p class="text-justify">(i) To provide you with Wowoo Services, including customer service support;</p>
        <p class="text-justify">(ii) To optimize and enhance Wowoo Services for all customers or for you specifically;</p>
        <p class="text-justify">(iii) To comply with legal obligations, including to conduct anti-fraud and identity verification and authentication checks (you authorize us to share your Personal Data with our third-party service providers, who may also conduct their own searches of publicly available Personal Data about you); and
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">(iv) To monitor the usage of Wowoo Services, conduct automated and manual security checks of our service, to protect our rights and perform our lawful obligations.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">Users in the EEA or the Channel Islands may withdraw consent at any time where consent is the lawful basis for processing their Personal Data. Should a User withdraw consent for processing or otherwise object to processing that impedes our ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations, a User may be unable to avail him or herself of the Services we provide.
        </p>

        <b>AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING</b>
        <p class="text-justify">We do not engage in automated decision-making.</p>

        <b>Non-Disclosure of Personal Data</b>
        <p class="text-justify">Our employees are prohibited, either during or after their employment, from disclosing Personal Data to any person or entity outside of our company, including family members, except under the circumstances described above. An employee is only permitted to disclose the Personal Data of a User to such other employees who need access to such information in order to deliver Wowoo Services to that User.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          If, as an EEA or Channel Islands Citizen, you believe that we have not adequately resolved any such issues, you have the right to contact your local supervisory authority.
        </p>

        <b>12. THIRD PARTY PERSONAL DATA</b>
        <p class="text-justify">Where you disclose Personal Data of other individuals to us, you warrant that such individuals have consented to us collecting, processing, using, disclosing and/or sharing such Personal Data for: (i) the relevant purpose for which you made the disclosure or as was notified to you at the relevant time; and (ii) the other purposes as described below in this Privacy Policy.
